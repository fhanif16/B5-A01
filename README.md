What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.
Enums in TypeScript allow us to create a set of named constants, making our code more readable and easier to manage. They provide a way to represent related values with descriptive names instead of using hard-to-remember numbers or strings. Enums can use both numeric and string values, depending on what's more appropriate for the context.
Enums in TypeScript help us group related values with clear names. For example, we can use a string enum like DayType { Weekday = "WEEKDAY", Weekend = "WEEKEND" } to label types of days clearly. A numeric enum like TrafficLight { Red, Yellow, Green } can represent traffic signals using numbers (0, 1, 2).

Enums make our code easier to read and maintain.

Conclusion:
Enums in TypeScript are a great way to improve code readability and organization. Numeric enums are ideal for representing sequences or standard values.



How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Project Maintainability

TypeScript improves code quality by catching errors while we're still writing, helping us identify mistakes early. It requires us to define variable and function types, making the code clearer and more maintainable.

With features like interfaces and enums, TypeScript helps organize code and ensures consistency, especially in large projects. It also provides clear error messages, making it easier to spot and fix issues.

For example, if we try to call add(5, "10") when the function expects numbers, TypeScript catches the error immediately. Without TypeScript, this error would only show up at runtime, making debugging harder. By catching errors early, TypeScript ensures our code works as expected and makes it easier to maintain.
