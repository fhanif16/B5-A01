What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.
Enums in TypeScript allow us to create a set of named constants, making our code more readable and easier to manage. They provide a way to represent related values with descriptive names instead of using hard-to-remember numbers or strings. Enums can use both numeric and string values, depending on what's more appropriate for the context.
Enums in TypeScript help us group related values with clear names. For example, we can use a string enum like DayType { Weekday = "WEEKDAY", Weekend = "WEEKEND" } to label types of days clearly. A numeric enum like TrafficLight { Red, Yellow, Green } can represent traffic signals using numbers (0, 1, 2).

Enums make our code easier to read and maintain.

Conclusion:
Enums in TypeScript are a great way to improve code readability and organization. Numeric enums are ideal for representing sequences or standard values.



How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Project Maintainability

TypeScript improves code quality by checking for errors while we are still writing the code, helping us catch mistakes early in the development process. It makes the code easier to understand by requiring us to define the types of variables and functions—whether they are numbers, strings, or more complex structures.

TypeScript also supports powerful features like interfaces and enums, which help us organize our code and ensure consistency, especially in large projects. If there’s a mistake, TypeScript provides clear error messages, making it easier for us to spot and fix issues.

This means that with TypeScript, our code is less likely to break, and it becomes much easier for us to maintain and extend over time.

TypeScript improves code by catching mistakes early—for example, if we write add(5, "10") and the function expects two numbers, it shows an error right away. This prevents bugs before the code even runs and makes our project easier to maintain.

Without TypeScript, this error would only show up at runtime, which could make it harder for us to debug. With TypeScript’s type checking, we catch it early, making our code more reliable and preventing potential bugs.

This is how TypeScript helps us improve code quality—by catching errors early, ensuring the code works as expected, and making it easier to fix issues.
